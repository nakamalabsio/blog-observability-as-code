# 🧠 Observability as Code: Managing Monitors with Terraform & GitOps for Datadog

This repository is part of a technical series published on [Medium](https://nakamalabsio.medium.com/observability-as-code-a-guide-to-managing-monitors-with-terraform-and-gitops-for-datadog-part-1-16a3593e1d72), focused on how to implement **Observability as Code** using **Terraform**, **GitOps**, and **Datadog**.

While Datadog is the example tool used, the approach can be generalized to other observability stacks as well (e.g. Prometheus, New Relic, Grafana Cloud).
